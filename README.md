This app uses jQuery, JS, HTML, and CSS to create a website which takes a form entry for your birthday, and uses a Birthdays API to share important figures with the same birth date. Additionally a script takes that date and sets a variable for what sunsign that date would fall within. From there, it takes an input for your sunsign and connects to a horoscopes API to share horoscope information.
